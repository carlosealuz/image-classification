# image-classification
This is a project to use pre-trained model to classify images.


I create this project to use pre-trained models with keras library and fine tune it to achieve my objective. The aim of the project was to classify images in two classes: "Animal" if in the image there is an animal and "Insect" if in the image there is an insect.

I got the images from google using a script to automatize the process. The dataset is not large but the approach used was enough to achieve a high accuracy model.

I used Google Colaboratory to train the model and connect with my google drive to import the dataset. After training and testing I saved the model and the weights also in google drive.


The next step is to train a new model to classify if the insect in the image can damage plants and crops or if the insect is a predator or parasitoid from other insects.
